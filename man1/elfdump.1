.SH NAME
elfdump \- An ELF file utility that specifically supports
viewing ELF files generated by 
.BR as218x "(1), " as219x "(1), and " ld21 (1).

.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B elfdump
.I file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Elfdump
dumps ELF object files. It understands machine types of EM_ADSP218X
and EM_ADSP219x and so displays executable progbits sections as 24
bit data and all other progbits sections as 16 bit data. This is not
intended to be a full featured ELF file utility since there are
much better ones like objdump which works fine except it doesn\'t
recognize some constants specific to files generated by
.BR as218x "(1), " as219x "(1), and " ld21 (1)
like the machine type and the relocation types.

One thing that elfdump can do which objdump doesn\'t do is dump an
executable file without a section header table. According to
Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Portable Format Specification 1.1
(the ELF specification) the section header table is optional in
an executable file.

.SH OPTIONS
NONE

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
None worth mentioning.

.SH KNOWN BUGS
It shouldn\'t exist but objdump doesn\'t handle unknowns very well.
