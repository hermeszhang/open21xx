.SH NAME
verify21 \- A tool to verify the object code generated by
.BR as218x "(1), and " as219x (1). 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B verify21
.RB [ \-Dv ] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Verify21
reads from stdin, expecting a file as generated by running
.BR as218x "(1) or " as219x (1)
with the \-dv command line option on a specially formatted
source file. On each line of the source file that generates code
a C++ style comment at the end of the line tells
.B Verify21
what to expect as generated code.
.B Verify21
only reads the address, assembled data, and the comment from
the generated listing.
.sp
The syntax of the C++ comment is an optional address
specification followed by one or more assembled data expressions
separated by spaces.
.sp
The address specification can be either \'=\' or \'&=\' followed by
an expression. This will assign
.BR Verify21 \'s
location counter a new value which will be incremented by 1 for each
line of assembled data read. The \'=\' operator simply assigns the
value of the following expression to the location counter. The \'&=\'
uses the following expression, which should be a power of two, for
alignment. Specically, the location counter is aligned on the next 
boundry divisible by the expression.
.sp
The address expression and assembled data expression can be a value
or a parenthesized expression. Values can be octal, decimal,
hexadecimal, or singly quoted character constants. Allowed operators
are \'&\', \'|\', \'<<\', \'>>\', \'(\', and \')\' with there usual
C meaning.
