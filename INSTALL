Open21xx should be relatively painless to build and install. You
need the following things installed before building open21xx:

libelf  - available from www.stud.uni-hannover.de/~michael/software/
gcc 	- actually any C compiler should do.
make	- I used GNU make during developement.
bison	- bison has the best support for multiple grammars used in
          the same executable.
FLEX	- And only FLEX. The assembler relies heavily on FLEX features.

Once the above things have been installed, untar open21xx, then do the
following:

	$ cd open21xx
	$ make
	$ make install

Thats it.

Open21xx was developed and tested on Linux so if you're running Linux you
shouldn't have any problems. It has not been tested on any other systems
yet. In any case, if you have problems, let me know. If you have patches,
please forward them to me and I will include them in the next release.
