There are five programs in this package. Three programs: as21,
ld21, and ez21 are an assembler, linker, and downloader respectively
for the ADSP-218x family of DSPs. The other two: elfdump and
verify21 are utilities used for developement of the other three
programs.

Legacy programs can be converted to the syntax used by as21.
For notes on converting source files see the as21 man page included.

An additional directory, samples contains a few simple demo programs.
These programs are specifically not GPLed. Stair.dsp and reverb.dsp are
used with permission but the folks giving me permission asked not to be
named since they don't want my mistakes haunting them. Pass.dsp,
ad1847.dsp, dlymain.dsp, and delay.dsp are original creations. You are
free to use and abuse these programs as you see fit.
